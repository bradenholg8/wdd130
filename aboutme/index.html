    <h2>Braden Holgate</h2>
    <h3>"Big B"</h3>
    <p>I was born in Ogden, Utah and have lived in Utah my entire life, except while serving a Mission in Paraguay.
        I currently am a Pest Control Technician with Beeline Pest Control and am working towards getting an Engineering Degree.
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my entire life and have never questioned my faith.
        I have been married to my wife, Alexis, since September 2019. We met using a dating app called "Mutual".
        We were married in the Ogden, Utah Temple and are working on having a family together. 
        She is a BYUI Alumni and is a fourth grade elementary school teacher for Weber School District.
        I enjoy playing video games in my spare time. Video games are a stuctured place to tell stories and exercise my mind.
