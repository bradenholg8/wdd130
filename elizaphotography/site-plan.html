        My site will be a place to hire someone (my sister, Eliza) to help capture special moments in 
        their lives. We all have cameras on our phones, but there is something special that comes 
        by hiring a professional photographer to capture the memories to remember. Many special opportunities 
        include family pictures, pictures of pets, of children, pictures of landscapes and nature, 
        misc pictures that peek your curiousity, and vacations. Photos of special events 
        are the most common. These include wedding days, receptions, Mission Callings 
        and Farewells, baby blessings, pregnancy announcements, gender reveals, 
        birthdays, or even days when you finally have the rare moments to have the entire
        family together and want an updated large family photo for the front room of your home.
